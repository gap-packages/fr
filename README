                             The FR package

This is the README file for the GAP package "FR".

This package implements Functionally Recursive and Mealy automata in
GAP. These objects can be manipulated as group elements, and various
specific commands allow their manipulation as automorphisms of infinite
rooted trees. Permutation quotients can also be created and manipulated
as standard GAP groups or semigroups.

This release (1.0) is the first containing all the planned functionality,
though some rough edges will still need to be smoothed. In particular,
the TODO file describes plans for future development, including
computations of presentations for self-similar groups, interval arithmetic
for complex dynamics, etc.

The package is distributed in source form, and does not require anything
else than a running GAP 4.5 or later. For updates, check

     http://www.uni-math.gwdg.de/laurent/FR/ (tar.gz formats)
and
     https://github.com/laurentbartholdi/fr (git)

To use the package, start GAP and type

LoadPackage("FR");

The "FR" package banner should appear on the screen.

For details on how to use the FR package, please consult the documentation.
Though this is usually not necessary, it may be recompiled, after the command
`LoadPackage("FR")', by invoking

DOC@fr();

at the GAP prompt. The documentation will then be available in the `doc'
subdirectory (view the file `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer).

An optional external module (DLL) provides floating-point functions used
by the "iterated monodromy groups" part of FR. Its presence or absence
does not affect the remainder of FR. To compile it, first make sure that
your system has C and JAVA compilers. You will need some external libraries,
in particular gsl, levmar, and libdogleg. To install them:

* on Linux, use a package-manager such as 'apt-get', 'rpm' if possible. On
  debian/ubuntu systems, you will need libgsl0-dev and libsuitesparse-dev.
* on UNIX systems, install the libraries:
  The gsl library may be found at http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/gsl/gsl-1.15.tar.gz
  The dogleg library may be found at https://github.com/Oblong/libdogleg.git
  The levmar library may be found at http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/levmar-2.6.tar.gz

* on Mac OSX, use 'homebrew' (http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/), and install the formulas by invoking
  % brew install libgsl
  % brew install https://raw.github.com/laurentbartholdi/homebrew/levenberg-marquardt-lib/Library/Formula/levmar.rb 
  % brew install https://raw.github.com/laurentbartholdi/homebrew/libdogleg/Library/Formula/libdogleg.rb

* on Windows, use an appropriate UNIX-like environment such as cygwin, and follow the UNIX
instructions.

In all cases, then run

'./configure && make' in FR's root directory.
